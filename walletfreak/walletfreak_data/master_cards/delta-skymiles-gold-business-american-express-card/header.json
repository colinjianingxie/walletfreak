The $150 Delta Stays credit and $0 introductory annual fee (for the first year) make it a no-brainer for small business owners who travel with Delta. While it lacks the lounge access and status boosts of the Platinum or Reserve, the 15% award discount and 2x miles on shipping and advertising offer strong ongoing value.",
