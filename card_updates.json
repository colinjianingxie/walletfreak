**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATES (READ CAREFULLY)**:
1. **CONSERVATIVE UPDATES**: The "CURRENT known data" provided above is heavily curated. **DO NOT CHANGE** values (especially multipliers or credits) unless you find **EXPLICIT, RECENT EVIDENCE** in the web search results that contradicts it (e.g., a "devaluation" or "new offer").
2. **Ambiguity**: If web results are ambiguous or unclear, **KEEP THE CURRENT VALUE**. Do not guess.
3. **Categories**: You MUST choose categories ONLY from the "Valid Categories Hierarchy" above.
4. **Specificity**: For `benefit_category` and `earning_rates.category`, select the most specific child category if applicable.
5. **No Duplicates**: **DO NOT CREATE DUPLICATE CATEGORIES**.
6. **No Inventions**: Do NOT invent new categories not in the list.

**SCHEMA RULES (Snake Case)**:
- **slug-id**: Must remain "citi-aadvantage-globe-mastercard".
- **name**: Card Name.
- **issuer**: e.g., "American Express", "Chase", "Capital One".
- **image_url**: "/static/images/credit_cards/citi-aadvantage-globe-mastercard.webp" (Keep as provided).
- **annual_fee**: Number (e.g. 95, 0 for no fee).
- **application_link**: Official URL to apply for the card.
- **min_credit_score**: Number (e.g. 670). Use 300 for secured cards.
- **max_credit_score**: Number (e.g. 850).
- **points_value_cpp**: Number or null (e.g. 1.5 for points cards, null for cash back).
- **is_524**: Boolean (true if applies to Chase 5/24 rule).
- **freak_verdict**: String: short opinion or "No Freak verdict for this card yet".

**HEADER FIELDS** (REQUIRED TO UPDATE):
ALL of these fields MUST be included in your response:
- `slug-id`: String (keep as provided)
- `name`: String (card name)
- `issuer`: String (e.g. "Citi", "Chase", "American Express")
- `image_url`: String (or null if not provided)
- `annual_fee`: Number (e.g. 95, use 0 for no fee)
- `application_link`: String (official application URL)
- `min_credit_score`: Number (e.g. 670, use 300 for secured cards)
- `max_credit_score`: Number (e.g. 850)
- `points_value_cpp`: Number or null (cents per point, null for cash back)
- `is_524`: Boolean (true/false), if having the card will affect chase 5/24 rule
- `freak_verdict`: String (brief verdict or "No Freak verdict for this card yet")

**BENEFITS** (REQUIRED TO UPDATE):
- **benefits**: List of objects.
- `benefit_id`: (IMPORTANT) Keep existing ID if updating an existing benefit (e.g. "dining-credit"). Create logical ID for new ones (e.g. "disney-bundle").
- `short_description`: e.g. "Uber Cash"
- `description`: Full text.
- `additional_details`: Brief context (e.g. "For prepaid hotel/vacation rental bookings").
- `benefit_category`: List of strings (e.g. ["Rideshare", "Dining"]).
- `benefit_type`: "Credit", "Perk", "Insurance".
- `numeric_value`: Float/Number (e.g. 200.0).
- `numeric_type`: "Cash", "Points", "Miles".
- `dollar_value`: Integer estimated dollar value (e.g. 200).
- `time_category`: "Annually (calendar year)", "Monthly", "One-time", "Per Use", "Quarterly".
- `enrollment_required`: Boolean.
- `effective_date`: String (YYYY-MM-DD) or null.

**CRITICAL FOR BENEFITS**:
- **SPLIT BUNDLED CREDITS**: If a card has a "total annual credit" composed of distinct parts (e.g., "$400 total credit" = "$200 Hotel Credit" + "$200 Airline Fee Credit"), you **MUST** create separate benefit objects for each distinct part. Do not bundle them.
- **Granularity**: We want detailed, separate benefits for tracking purposes.

**EARNING RATES** (REQUIRED TO UPDATE):
- **earning_rates**: List of objects. **EVERY card MUST have at least one earning rate** - at minimum an "All Other Purchases" default rate.
- `rate_id`: (IMPORTANT) Keep existing ID (e.g. "dining"). For new cards, create logical IDs like "dining", "travel", "all-other".
- `multiplier`: Number (e.g. 4.0, 1.5, 1.0 for base rate).
- `category`: List of strings (e.g. ["Dining", "Resy Bookings"]). **Must be a list**. Use ["Financial Rewards", "All Purchases"] for the default rate.
- `additional_details`: **REQUIRED**. Specific string detailing conditions (e.g. "on purchases made directly with airlines"). Use "on all other purchases" for default.
- `is_default`: Boolean (True for "All other purchases" rate, False for bonus categories).

**CRITICAL**: You MUST generate earning rates for new cards. Every card earns something on purchases - research and include:
1. Bonus category rates (e.g., 3x on dining)
2. Default "all other purchases" rate (usually 1x or 1% or 2%)

**SIGN-UP BONUS** (REQUIRED TO UPDATE):
- **sign_up_bonus**: List of objects (usually 1).
- `offer_id`: (CRITICAL FOR VERSIONING) If an object exists in the current data's `sign_up_bonus`, you MUST maintain the SAME `offer_id` (e.g. "offer-1") when updating the value or terms of the current public offer. DO NOT create new IDs like "offer-75k" or "limited-time-offer". Only change the ID if this is a completely different promotion type (e.g., switching from points to cash back).
- `value`: Number (integer).
- `terms`: e.g. "Spend $4k in 3 months".
- `currency`: Exactly one of: "Points", "Miles", "Cash".
- If no sign-up bonus currently exists, return an empty list [].
- If a bonus existed but has expired with no replacement, return an empty list [].

**QUESTIONS** (REQUIRED TO UPDATE):
- **questions**: List of objects. Generating 3-5 questions based on benefits is REQUIRED if list is empty.
- `question_id`: e.g. "q-0".
- `short_desc`: e.g. "Uber Cash".
- `question`: "Do you use Uber...?"
- `question_type`: "multiple_choice" or "boolean".
- `choices`: ["Yes", "No", "Sometimes"].
